BASE PLOT:

(Protagonist) is a young woman working for a major tech company. She lives a normal life, programming her days away in her office, 
though she struggles to make friends in her day to day life. She has a secret project though, she doesn't tell anyone about. She 
has been programming an immersive VR game, that takes place in a fantasy world. Where anyone can be anything they want to be, and in this
world, (protagonist) is a catgirl ( are you happy now, noah). She ventures to this world everyday after she gets home from work, making new
allies in the magical world, as she learns to fight and explores dangerous dungeons. She discovers amazing things in this world made of code, 
but one day, things start to change ever so slightly. The game world starts acting buggy, and one day, the door that takes her back home is glitched
out of existence. The glitchy darkness starts to spread, and its up to her to stop it in order to get back home.
